<p>This project was inspired by an undergraduate poetry workshop I took with Zoë Brigley Thompson at Ohio State.</p>
<p>The exercise was to take a pre-existing poem (yours or someone else's) and replace each noun with the noun that appear 7 positions after it in the dictionary. Alternatively, one could cycle the nouns within the poem 7 spots.</p>
<p>The prompt was to then take a line from the mutated poem and write a poem based on it. The writer could then remove the original line or keep it.</p>
<br>
<p>Zoë's exercise was inspired by the OuLiPo movement, which you can read about <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/oulipo">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>This application automates cycling nouns, adjectives and lines. Perhaps in the future, this application will also support the dictionary exercise.. We'll see!</p>
